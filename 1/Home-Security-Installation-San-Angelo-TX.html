<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the required systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and setup details to make this combination work, there are only two choices. The very first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is not available or unwilling to offer those information) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to replace and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
