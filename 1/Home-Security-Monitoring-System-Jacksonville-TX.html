<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras.
