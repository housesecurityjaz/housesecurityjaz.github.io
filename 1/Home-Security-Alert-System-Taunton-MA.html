<p>While some parts may be impacted temporarily by a power outage, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours up until the electrical service is restored. Landline systems use conventional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
<p>ADT uses local installers to provide hands-on support throughout the country. We advise SafeStreets, an installer that can typically offer same-day or next-day equipment installation.
