<p>First and foremost, it's difficult to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's much better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of use, night and day images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We have actually seen it highlight moths, cars and trucks, and mice.</p>

However because a lot of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyhow (a worker slipping some extra cash while giving a customer modification, for instance), we believe it's more crucial to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you require. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
