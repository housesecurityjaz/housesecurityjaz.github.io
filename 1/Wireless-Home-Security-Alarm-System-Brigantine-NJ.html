When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

They use versatility in their equipment and available strategies, allowing property owners to select the security service that best suits their requirements. Sadly, there are some drawbacks to Protect America indicated by their low C- rating from BBB. A majority of the grievances center around misinformation relating to the necessary three year agreement.
