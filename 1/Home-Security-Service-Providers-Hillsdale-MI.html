<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has identified burglars or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work.
