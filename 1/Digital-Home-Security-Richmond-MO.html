<p>The Canary Flex features an intelligent version that sends notifies straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the road. Not great, not horrible, however with a really simple setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer function when it concerns clever cameras.) This more recent version is similar, to be frank.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
