<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies?

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who truly is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody!

If a person was standing watching outside a window it might be a crime, yet the exact same person could position a surveillance camera then from another location see a person within the privacy of their home. Most notably, it is not against the penal code.</p>
