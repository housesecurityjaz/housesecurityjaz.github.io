<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It won't work with loads of clever home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely excellent, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly simple.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed main monitoring station.

In situations like these, you're paying for the service and not the equipment, so you're taking a look at anywhere from $29-$ 50 a month.</p>
