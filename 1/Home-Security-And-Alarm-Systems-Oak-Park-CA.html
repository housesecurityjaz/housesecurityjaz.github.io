<h3>Home Security Monitoring Service in California</h3>
<p>Smart alarms are just as efficient as standard alarm systems but they don't constantly have an external siren that sits on the front of your home, which can act as a deterrent to burglars.

This means that consumers have plenty to select from.</p>
<p>You'll get updated equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensing units in its basic bundle, consisting of both fire and CO alarms. If wise home security is what you're after, we recommend looking into Vivint or ADT prior to jumping on the cheaper, Do It Yourself bandwagon.

<p>Activity notifications alert the user whenever significant activity is discovered near the camera. Learn if you can get notices through push notifications, text, and or email. They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're spending for is primarily that huge name in blue. </p>
