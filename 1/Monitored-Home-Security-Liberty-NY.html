We've seen enhancements throughout our short time with the battery-operated camera, however we just can't recommend a $200 camera that doesn't offer the capability to zoom video and won't have the ability to hold up against outdoor temperature levels listed below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

Use a desktop, laptop computer, tablet or choose smart device to gain access to live and taped video coverage from a secure IP connection.</p>

With companies like LifeShield, your system is mostly wireless so you do not need to stress over cutting cables or losing power.</p>
