Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
