<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
