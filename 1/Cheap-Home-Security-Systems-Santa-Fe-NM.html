<p>The huge reward is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that does not look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it hardly ever sends false notifies due to the fact that it tracks your phone (and other member of the family's phones), so understands when you're at home and turns everything off.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
