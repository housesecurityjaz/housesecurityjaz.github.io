<h2>Best Security Camera System For Your Business In 2020 in  Ashland</h2>
<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
