In this short article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
