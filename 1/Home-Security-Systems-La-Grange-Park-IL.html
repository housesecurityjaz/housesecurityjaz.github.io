<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup process. This normally involves discovering a spot for your camera, creating an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are various in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.
