<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
