<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
