<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the required systems is required. There are only 2 alternatives if there are no as-built documents offering functionality and configuration info to make this integration work. The very first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unavailable or unwilling to supply those details) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the properties control system contacts a main monitoring station.
