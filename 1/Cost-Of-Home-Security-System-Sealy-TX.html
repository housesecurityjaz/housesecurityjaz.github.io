<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical type of two piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or typically closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as in the case of proximity to the second piece which includes a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether or not the design is typically open or typically closed. This action coupled with an electric current (generally at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit.

The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be attained with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of photo required or wanted).

<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Select particular functions that match your circumstance. For instance, if you experience frequent power outages, a security system that uses battery back-up would be an useful choice.
