<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
