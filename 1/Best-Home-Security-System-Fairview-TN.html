<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and belongings. In case your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to respond by instantaneously getting in touch with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
