Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

The video recorder should be acquired separately, and commercial grade recorders start at about $500 (US $) and can range as much as $5000 depending upon the amount of storage, camera connectivity, and image processing functions.</p>
