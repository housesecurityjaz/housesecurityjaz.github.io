<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
