<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even activate false alarms.

Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
