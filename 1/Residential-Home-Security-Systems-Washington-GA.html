<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger false alarms.

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
