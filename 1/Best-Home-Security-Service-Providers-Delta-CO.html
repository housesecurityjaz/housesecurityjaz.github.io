A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, supplying trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we developed security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're transforming the wise home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.

<p>A routine battery-powered wireless camera still needs to be plugged in where solar cameras are totally wire-free. On the other hand, an alarm that is expertly monitored streamlines this procedure.
