<p>Nevertheless, convenience does not always feature included security. Going from wired to wireless security means potentially exposing yourself to outside attacks if you don't do it right.

<p>This typically would enter a closet or energy room somewhere in the facilities. It is utilized in older or bigger systems to connect the components. Generally you would find a PCB with lots of terminals or antennas for connections. Lots of also have integrated backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port.
