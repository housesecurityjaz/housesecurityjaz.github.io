Now, most security systems involve a great number of elements, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and essential fobs, among other elements.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens.
