<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's expense from Comcast.

You will not get a cash or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise required under appropriate law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by applicable law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any quantities due on your account (including, without limitation, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, modified or not returned).</p>

<p>If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten trespassers for the most part. To hold and recoup expenses alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a broken window to warrant cops reaction.</p>
