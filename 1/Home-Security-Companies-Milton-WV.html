<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has spotted trespassers or wild animals.
