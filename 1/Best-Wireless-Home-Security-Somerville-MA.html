<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are various because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
