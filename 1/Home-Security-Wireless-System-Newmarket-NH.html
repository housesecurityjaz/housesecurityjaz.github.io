<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
