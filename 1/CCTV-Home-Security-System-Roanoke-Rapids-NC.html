Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
