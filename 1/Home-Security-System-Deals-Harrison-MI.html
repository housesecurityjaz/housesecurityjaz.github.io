<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and possessions. In the event that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are waiting to respond by immediately contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>

<p>A couple of things stand out about Link Interactive compared to other companies-- especially the much shorter agreements.
