<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and possessions. In the event that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are waiting to respond by immediately contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>The ADT Indoor security camera links to your ADT security system to help secure your home. It's developed with motion detection, night vision and 720p HD video quality.

Possibly much more disturbing is the concept of some stranger monitoring video from your outdoor and indoor security cameras.</p>
<p>A couple of things stand out about Link Interactive compared to other companies-- especially the much shorter agreements.
