<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
