<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage.

Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
