<p>Do burglar alarms represent theft decreases in the United States? The U.S. burglary rate has decreased steadily and substantially considering that the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the exact same time, the variety of facilities with alarms rose, however there is no evidence of a link between the 2. Throughout the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high rise, other types of criminal activity declined just as dramatically as break-in, recommending that aspects aside from a boost in the number of alarm systems sustained the burglary decline.</p>
