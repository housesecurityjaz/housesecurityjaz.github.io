<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
