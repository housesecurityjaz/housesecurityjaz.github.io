<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
