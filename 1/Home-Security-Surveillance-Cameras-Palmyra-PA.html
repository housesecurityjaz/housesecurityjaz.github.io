<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
