<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

Sadly, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not everything works as it should; nevertheless, the potential is still there.</p>

<p>The 2nd essential thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill in-built alarm, so it functions as a home alarm as well as a security camera.
