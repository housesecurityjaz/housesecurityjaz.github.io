<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensing units. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This implies that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, particularly if your home is bigger than 4,500 square feet.

<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was developed for homeowners. It must be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, once installed, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for large homes and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. The team will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring if you have actually currently set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system.

Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable cost, the one location where the company particularly excels is in DIY installation. </p>
