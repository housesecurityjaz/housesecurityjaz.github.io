<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
