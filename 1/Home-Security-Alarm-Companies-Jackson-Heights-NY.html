We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
