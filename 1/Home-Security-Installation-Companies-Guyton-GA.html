<p>Another essential topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>

We create HD CCTV systems for brand name new purchases. A1 Security Cameras has a group of professional consultants here with years of hands on experience. When we mean "hands on experience", we imply going up the ladder, running cable televisions, screening security cameras of all sorts and the entire nine yards that you will have to do to install security camera systems. We are more like Home Depot when it concerns security cameras. We have the proficiency when you need to decide in between brands, technologies, items.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the facilities control unit contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, notifying police, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals might be transmitted by means of dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.</p>

The camera consists of functions like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take snapshots of activity and can't move or pan-- basic functions found on many surveillance cameras. </p>
