We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts!

<p>We tried to find Do It Yourself systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies supply free or greatly affordable hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals might wish to register for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for instance.

When a client presses the emergency button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other wise devices and can not be controlled remotely.
