<p>The 2nd essential thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill in-built alarm, so it functions as a home alarm system as well as a security camera.

<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more cost effective memberships out there at $2.99 a month.

Increasing release of voice over IP innovation (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of websites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
