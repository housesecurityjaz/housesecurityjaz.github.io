<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
