<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems usually do not included upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>

We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect signals). However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have additional sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
