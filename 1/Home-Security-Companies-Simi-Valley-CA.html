<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
