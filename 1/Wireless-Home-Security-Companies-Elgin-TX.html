<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
