<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
