Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific circumstances such as baby-sitter webcams or signing in on a pet, though when wanting to gather evidence of a crime they frequently come up short.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is sent to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched instantly.
