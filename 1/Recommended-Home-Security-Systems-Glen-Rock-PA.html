<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place often enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
