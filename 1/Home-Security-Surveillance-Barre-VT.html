<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.
