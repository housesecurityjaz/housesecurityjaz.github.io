Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes low or missing (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious attacker, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive aggressor to tape these codes and utilize various breaking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
<p>Motion detectors are frequently stationed at entry walls and in big spaces, and they are easy to establish.
