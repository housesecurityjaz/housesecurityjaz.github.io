<h2>What To Look For In A Home Security Camera System Patterson</h2>
<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost.

<p>Reception - Most reception locations in a business will be highly trafficked, therefore a perfect location for a camera installation. Concealing a camera within a frame, clock, sprinkler head, or smoke detector might make a reception security camera more effective, but make sure to check with state laws concerning the legality of a hidden camera before doing so.</p>
<p>Additionally, recognize that your whole system might not be designed to operate during a power interruption.
