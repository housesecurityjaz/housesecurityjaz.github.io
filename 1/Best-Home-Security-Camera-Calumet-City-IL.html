<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This option is usually cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is usually a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend on how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>
