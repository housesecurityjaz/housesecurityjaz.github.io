<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
