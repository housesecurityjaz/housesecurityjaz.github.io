<p>All persons with alarm systems safeguarding a property in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm authorization. A growing variety of individuals use clever home gadgets to control things remotely, like the thermostat or lights. Voice activation platforms like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant prevail as well. There are self-monitored systems that use home automation combinations, many of which work with wise locks as well. Most of the companies define their automation alternatives on the home page.</p>

A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually evaluated separately and don't suggest for most people.</p>
