<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt should have the ability to endure direct exposure to the components and must carry an IP (Ingress Protection) ranking IP ratings include 2 digits that tell you just how well the camera will hold up under most weather conditions. The very first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid objects such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection versus dust and dirt). The second number tells you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (secured against close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>

Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, however low signal strength and poor connection are still typical complaints. Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and except a basic power interruption, are more difficult to disrupt. Despite a general improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and disabled. </p>
