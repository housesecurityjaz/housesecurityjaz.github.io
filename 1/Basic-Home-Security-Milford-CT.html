<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

If there are cameras recording you, it is really challenging to get away with taking something. Therefore, the thief will typically get caught.
