When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
