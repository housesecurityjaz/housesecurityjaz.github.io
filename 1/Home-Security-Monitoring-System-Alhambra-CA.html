If there are no as-built files supplying performance and setup details to make this integration work, there are only 2 choices. The first choice, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or unwilling to offer those information) and record the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
