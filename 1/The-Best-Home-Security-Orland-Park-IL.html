<p>After reading the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they provided; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I believe starts at $0 down.

Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away intruders most of the times. To hold and recoup costs alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you.
