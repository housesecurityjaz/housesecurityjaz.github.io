<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable price, the one area where the company especially excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
