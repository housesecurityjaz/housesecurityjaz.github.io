<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was invented for house owners. It needs to be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, once installed, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for large properties and are frequently more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your house. The team will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring if you've already installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send out smartphone notifies with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
