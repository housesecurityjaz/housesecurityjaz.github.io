<h3>CCTV Home Security System in Michigan</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has gotten rather the excitement throughout the years. We've been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security set that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you select the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>There's a main 100db siren here too (silenced by the top button) which might be helpful if your cameras are all mounted outside - and doing so isn't a problem, with each carrying an IP65 score that indicates they'll hold up against a jet from a pipe. For fixing, you have the option of either a strong magnetic ball mount or a standard tripod screw.</p>

<p>Vivint's monitoring fees remain in line with our other top security companies, which is excellent given the innovative proprietary equipment and services that include a Vivint home security system. We also like that Vivint offers you the option to buy your equipment outright, which suggests you're off the hook for a long-term contract-- but that does require a substantial up-front payment.</p>
