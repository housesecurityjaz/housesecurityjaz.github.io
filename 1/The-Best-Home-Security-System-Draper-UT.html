<p>SimpliSafe can not guarantee against burglaries or theft, like most home security system service providers (except for ADT). Also, another possible disadvantage, since of their no contract feature, they need you to buy their equipment upfront.

<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it says deserves $1,300. The equipment's all provided by third parties, so what you get may be from a different manufacturer than the equipment your next-door neighbor got. Why's that? ADT uses an independent distributor model including third-party dealerships. The dealerships figure out which equipment to utilize.</p>
