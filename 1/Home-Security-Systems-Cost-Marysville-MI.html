<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize crime. Wired: Each camera is linked to a recording unit, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complicated - especially if your home has actually currently been constructed - so be sure to talk to a professional before taking on the task yourself. Wired home security cameras send information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not susceptible to disturbance such as cellular and radio frequencies.
