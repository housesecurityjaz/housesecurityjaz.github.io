<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long variety situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Most notably, the local drive might fill up - particularly if you tape-record everything. This suggests that you can no longer conserve video footage till you unload a few of the saved data.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If recording video footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
