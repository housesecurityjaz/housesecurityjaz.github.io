Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is a lot of offered light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being missing or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show. Due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture exceptional low light video, commercial cameras outperform their cheaper cousins.</p>
