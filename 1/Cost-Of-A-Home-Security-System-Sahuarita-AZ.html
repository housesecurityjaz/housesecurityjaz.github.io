<h3>Security Camera System For Home Sahuarita AZ 85629</h3>
<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
