<p>When set off, burglar alarms most frequently do 7 main jobs. The first job is the alert of a siren, this enables everyone in your community including the homeowners or entrepreneur to know that an intruder has been found. The 2nd job is flashing outdoor lights. Not all alarm systems have flashing outdoor lights however the most common burglar alarms and a few of the more advanced ones do. The most common type of burglar alarms have an automobile dialer which notifies police in the area to dispatch to the business or the home that is being broken into.

Hardwired systems require very little upkeep, and except a basic power failure, are more difficult to interfere with. In spite of a general improvement in wireless technology, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and incapacitated. </p>
