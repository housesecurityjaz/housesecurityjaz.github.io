There are advantages to both landline and cellular monitoring, so don't simply count on price when making your option. Home alarm systems monitored with a standard landline don't require power to work. Even if you're out of power for days, the system needs to still have the ability to call for aid.

<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both animals and humans. Given that carbon monoxide is odor-free and colorless, the only way to monitor damaging levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your home increases to a hazardous level.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
