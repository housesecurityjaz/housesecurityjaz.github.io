The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the malicious attacker to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system.
