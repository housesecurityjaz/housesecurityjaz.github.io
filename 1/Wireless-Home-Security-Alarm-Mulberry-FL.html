<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. Standard components in the majority of home security packages include a master control panel, the control keypad, sensing unit pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit device. Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms.
