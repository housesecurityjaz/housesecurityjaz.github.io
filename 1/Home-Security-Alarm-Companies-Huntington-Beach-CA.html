<h3>Local Home Security Monitoring in California</h3>
<p>A little more expensive than our winning clever alarm, this system was nearly as basic to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had actually been activated. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false signals). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensing units and essential fobs, too.</p>
