<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
