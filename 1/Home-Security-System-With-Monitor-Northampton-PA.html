However today you'll find more home security choices than ever prior to that offer much shorter contracts and month-to-month (contract-free) terms-- specifically if you can pay for equipment in advance.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
