<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
