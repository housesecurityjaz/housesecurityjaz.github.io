<h3>Home Security System Review in California</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's stats since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is a solid all-around camera that works inside or out, and it's incredibly easy to install. The biggest drawback is the investment. You need to acquire a base station in addition to 2 cameras, which makes the up-front cost more significant than other cameras. Vivint is an exceptional choice for those trying to find a wise home security system that incorporates economical, energy-efficient technology. The company's Nest Thermostat E, Nest Knowing Thermostat, Component Thermostat, and Philips Shade can be added to any security package. All of them can be managed by Vivint's mobile app.</p>
