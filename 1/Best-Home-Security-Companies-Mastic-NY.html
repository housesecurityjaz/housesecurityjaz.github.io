If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you commit to a three-year contract, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan opts for $10 per month and does not require a contract.</p>
