<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.
