<h3>Home Camera System Hastings MN 55033</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
