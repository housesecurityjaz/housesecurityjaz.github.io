<p>These cameras can catching and transferring extremely delicate information," says Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Laboratory. That's why we evaluate them for information security and information privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or someone, mostly to prevent or identify crime.

We've likewise tried to limit this list to cameras that can dish out informs that are really useful and trustworthy - if your camera is pinging your phone each time a leaf blows past, you're quickly going to get sick of having to check it.</p>
