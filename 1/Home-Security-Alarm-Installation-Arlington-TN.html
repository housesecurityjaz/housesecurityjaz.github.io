<p>Video recording isn't a basic alternative on most security systems. Property owners searching for a system that provides video recording need to make certain the option is readily available instead of presume it is. Storing video is also an issue.

There are a handful of companies that use complimentary video storage, however the video is sent out to a cloud account and just kept for a couple of days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a regular monthly storage charge.</p>
