<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
