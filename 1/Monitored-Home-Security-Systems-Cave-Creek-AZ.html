<h3>Cost For Home Security System in Arizona</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life by far.
