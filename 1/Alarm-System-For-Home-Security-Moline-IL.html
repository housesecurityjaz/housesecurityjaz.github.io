You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it ought to immediately know.</p>

Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing games for a very long time and a lot of the things in earlier video games I have actually played a decade ago would definitely NEVER EVER make the cut in todays politically charged gaming environment.</p>
