<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen regularly enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick action times and overall versatility. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and simple and easy smooth.

Offered all of the other benefits, it's simple to see why a lot of people are selecting this option. </p>
