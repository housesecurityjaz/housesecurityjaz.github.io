We particularly like this camera's large, 180-degree field of vision, since you're less likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>This self monitored alarm system has four smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera turns on or off depending on your area. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree wide angle lens that reduces all blind spots and gives you access to a wider field of view than most cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that allows you to focus and capture information such as facial features in case of break-ins.</p>
<p>We have evaluated many crucial reasons why one need to think about commercial-grade cameras so far, however, we have simply skimmed the surface of the topic. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is seldom a stand-alone system. It is worth understanding if your proposed camera system will incorporate with other products. </p>
