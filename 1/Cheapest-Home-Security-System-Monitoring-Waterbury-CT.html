<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We likewise require to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one!
