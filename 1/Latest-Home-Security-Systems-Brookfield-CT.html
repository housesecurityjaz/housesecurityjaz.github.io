<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, but considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
