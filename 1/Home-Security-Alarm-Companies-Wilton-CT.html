Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
