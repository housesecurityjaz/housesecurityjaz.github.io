<p>Frontpoint equipment rates is on the low end, but its monitoring services begin at a slightly greater price point than the entry-level services of its rivals. However, Frontpoint offers all clients advantages that are frequently only readily available through higher-tier plans at other service providers, such as total mobile app access and Crash & Smash" protection.

The Nest Labs Nest Webcam delivers higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Increase into security services fits with this, too.
