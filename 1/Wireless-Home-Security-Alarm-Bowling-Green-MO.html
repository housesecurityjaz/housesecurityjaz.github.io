<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, vandalism, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the usual motion notifies, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to frighten any approaching burglar before they have actually got too far into your home. When you're at home and do not want to be tape-recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>Video surveillance system monitoring goes beyond the basic surveillance system by enabling experienced specialists to respond to an occurrence in real-time. Live feed from your cameras is monitored by either trained internal staff members or customized and professional security provider.
