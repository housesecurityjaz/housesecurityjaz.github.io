<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup process. This usually includes finding an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great choice for long range circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Costs for systems vary. Larger systems that offer full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most costly alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>

Why bother getting that expensive alarm if you regularly leave the front door opened and have such dim lighting that a camera can't record a clear image anyhow?
