<p>If you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at, there's no use in having an outdoor security camera.

We truly took pleasure in utilizing Nest Secure for home protection and automation, however bear in mind that it can get expensive if you don't already have a Nest clever home environment set up. We 'd most likely suggest a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're starting from scratch.</p>
