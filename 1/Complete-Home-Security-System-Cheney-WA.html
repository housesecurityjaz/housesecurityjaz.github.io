<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
