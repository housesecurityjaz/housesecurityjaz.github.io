<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
