<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, come with long and usually onerous agreements, and frequently rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little benefit.
