<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

Much like indoor cameras, consider how videos are saved, when the camera will film, and the quality of the video. You will get the best outdoor protection from cameras with a wide field of view, high resolution video, and continuous video feed that is published to the cloud.</p>
