Watch on your home, office, or store with our video surveillance systems. Use a desktop, laptop, tablet or choose smartphone to gain access to live and documented video protection from a secure IP connection.</p>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.
