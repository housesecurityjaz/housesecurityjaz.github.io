<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be harmful to both people and animals.

With a wireless system, you can also receive push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is an issue, even when you're not at home.</p>

<p>Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera gives you an outstanding visual field, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.)

<p>Furthermore they can not transfer fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution snippets of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly helping customers change. As experts in the industry our guidance is to stay away.
