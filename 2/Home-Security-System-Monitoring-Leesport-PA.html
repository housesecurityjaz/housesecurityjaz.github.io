<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. Commercial residential or commercial properties tend to have even higher false alarm rates than homes due to the fact that more individuals tend to share duty for activating and shutting off the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complicated.

For longer access to video, expect to pay a regular monthly storage cost.</p>

Some models utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
