As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
