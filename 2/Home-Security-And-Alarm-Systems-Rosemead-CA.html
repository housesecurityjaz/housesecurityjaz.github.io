<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
