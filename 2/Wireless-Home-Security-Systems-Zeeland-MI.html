But suicide enemies are clearly not discouraged by camera - and may even be attracted to the television protection cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the limited benefits that the system might supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

Who will hear and respond to the alarm? Etc. If that system is not monitored, less than half the protection the consumer expects is being supplied.</p>
