<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room.
