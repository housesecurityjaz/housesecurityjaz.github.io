<h3>Residential Alarm Monitoring in Easton CT</h3>
<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control panel (generally positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to equip and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensors have actually been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).

When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
