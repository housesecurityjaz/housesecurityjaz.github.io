<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
