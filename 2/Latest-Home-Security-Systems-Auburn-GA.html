<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection devices are designed to protect specific, tangible possessions, such as precious jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family treasures.

<p>The other significant decision when picking a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera.
