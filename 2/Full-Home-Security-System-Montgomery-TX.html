<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 businesses, universities, and federal government facilities, and residential clients. Non-traditional networks such as individual network Bluetooth gadgets are not safe from hacking and should be considered a security risk. Even barcode readers, handheld PDAs, and wireless printers and copiers should be secured. These non-traditional networks can be quickly ignored by IT personnel who have narrowly focused on laptops and access points.</p>
<p>Years back, all alarm required you to have a landline phone which landline was used to link your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other choices. However, today, many individuals do not even have a landline phone since they utilize their smart phones for everything. For that reason, a wireless security system is now the most apparent option for lots of people, specifically those who don't have a landline and don't want to rely exclusively on their internet connection.</p>

<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private guard. Numerous cities also need a license to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
