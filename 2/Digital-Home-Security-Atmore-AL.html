<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
