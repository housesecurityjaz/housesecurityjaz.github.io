<h3>Wireless Home Security Systems in Arizona</h3>
<p>Wireless cameras can be an excellent service for a video surveillance system.

Client purchase all their equipment upfront and can register for month-to-month monitoring for $10-15.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is among the most common sensors found in household and small business environments. It provides inexpensive and dependable functionality. The term passive refers to the reality that the detector does not create or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by discovering the heat energy emitted by other things. </p>
