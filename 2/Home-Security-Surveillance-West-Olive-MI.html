<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
