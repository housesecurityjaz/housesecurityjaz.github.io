We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
