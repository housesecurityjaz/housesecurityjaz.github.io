<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
