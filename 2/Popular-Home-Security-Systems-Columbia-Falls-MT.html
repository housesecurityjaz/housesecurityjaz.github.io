<p>As the name recommends, this alarm system is a starter package". So it's pretty much anticipated that it won't have extended customizability or a large range of features.

Cameras are quite standard for self monitored alarm systems, specifically because incorrect alarms is a really real possibility.</p>
<p>Night vision: The majority of burglaries take place after dark, so this function is nearly as crucial as motion detection.

<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must have the ability to withstand direct exposure to the components and must bring an IP (Ingress Protection) ranking IP scores consist of two digits that inform you simply how well the camera will hold up under many weather. The first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of strong things such as wind-blown dust and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection against dust and dirt).
