If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
