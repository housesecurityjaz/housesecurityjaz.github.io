Most alarm companies that will install a consumer security system typically charge a $99 installation cost plus monthly monitoring charges.</p>

Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was polite, prompt, and sincere (even minimizing his costs after recognizing they didn't require to install one camera).

If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
