<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>

Take a while, look it over, and consider it. Examine the alarm company's credibility by calling the Better Business Bureau, or calling the Florida Department of Business and Professional Guideline or the Alarm Association of Florida.
