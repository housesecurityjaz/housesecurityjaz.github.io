<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since obviously they vehicle restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.
