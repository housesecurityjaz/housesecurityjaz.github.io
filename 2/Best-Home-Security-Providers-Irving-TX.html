<p>Control: Due to the fact that smart alarm systems do not need to include an alarm monitoring company, the client can maintain control.

<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, typically utilize battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have less costly start-up costs, but may fail if the batteries are not maintained. Depending on range and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters might be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who rent or who move regularly. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one between the control board and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm protects versus a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of an internet provider. This complete wireless setup is typically referred to as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>It's not almost security from theft, either.
