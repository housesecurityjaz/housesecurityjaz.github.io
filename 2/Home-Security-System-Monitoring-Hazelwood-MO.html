We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
