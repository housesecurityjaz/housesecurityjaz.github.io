<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment up front offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as often times as you want.</p>

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
