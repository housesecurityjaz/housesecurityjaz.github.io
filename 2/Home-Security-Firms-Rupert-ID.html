<p>One of the top home security providers given that entering the business in 1992, Protect America offers service for hundreds of thousands of customers around the United States and Canada. They use versatility in their equipment and available strategies, allowing house owners to pick the security service that best fits their requirements. Sadly, there are some disadvantages to Safeguard America indicated by their low C- rating from BBB. A majority of the grievances center around false information concerning the necessary three year agreement. In reality, many customers were not aware they were making such a long term commitment. This, combined with the extreme charge for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may offer some time out in picking Protect America as their home security option.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies extensively depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
