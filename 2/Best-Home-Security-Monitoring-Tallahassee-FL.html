<p>A little more expensive than our winning smart alarm, this system was nearly as basic to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensing units had actually been triggered. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false alerts). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have key fobs and extra sensors, too.</p>
