However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide.
