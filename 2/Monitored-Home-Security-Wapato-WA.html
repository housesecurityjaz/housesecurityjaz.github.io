<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set quantity of time, typically one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract.

Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year contract, but since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
