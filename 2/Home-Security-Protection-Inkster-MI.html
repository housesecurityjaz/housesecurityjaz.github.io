<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>When your camera are set up, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is triggered. However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the client. </p>
