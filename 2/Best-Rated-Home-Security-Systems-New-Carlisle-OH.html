Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
