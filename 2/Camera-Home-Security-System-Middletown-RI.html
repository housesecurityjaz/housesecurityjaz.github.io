<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
