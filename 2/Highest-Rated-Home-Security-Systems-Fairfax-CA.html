Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>On the surface, these 2 camera categories might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions become apparent and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and when the lighting ends up being low or missing (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal. Because they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and catch outstanding low light video, commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins.</p>
