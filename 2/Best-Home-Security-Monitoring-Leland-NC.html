<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
