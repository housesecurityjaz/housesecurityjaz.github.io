<p>We attempted each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one area where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
