Its most direct rival is the Ring Spotlight Camera Battery, which costs $199. You can preorder the Essential Spotlight Camera on Arlo's site, and it's anticipated to ship July 13.</p>
<p>Video and image feeds have actually proved invaluable for surveillance - but there's room for more functionality by using audio.
