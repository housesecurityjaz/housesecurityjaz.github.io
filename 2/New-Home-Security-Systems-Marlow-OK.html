<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
