While some cameras still let you see a couple of days of recorded video, the pattern has actually been to only let you see live video from your camera unless you register for a membership. That means you can't recall a couple of hours or days to see who was walking through your lawn. And, the majority of subscription plans also consist of additional features, such as custom motion zones.</p>
