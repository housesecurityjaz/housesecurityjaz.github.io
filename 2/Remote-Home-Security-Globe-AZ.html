<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. As soon as a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the very same individual might position a surveillance camera then from another location view an individual within the personal privacy of their home.
