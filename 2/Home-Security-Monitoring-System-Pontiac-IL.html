<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was invented for homeowners. It needs to be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, once set up, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for large properties and are frequently more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your house. If you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the group will have the ability to reuse the existing wiring. Nevertheless, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>

Analog cameras have actually been around for several years and are still the most common type of CCTV camera installed today. They have basic functionality and store video onsite. </p>
