Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off).

We enjoy that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false notifies). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
