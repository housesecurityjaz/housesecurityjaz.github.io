We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
