<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents offering functionality and setup details to make this integration work, there are only two options. The very first alternative, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unavailable or reluctant to offer those information) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Wired systems use permanence and greater dependability, while wireless systems provide a high level of personalization and the ease of movement.
