To hold and recoup costs alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to require cops action.</p>
