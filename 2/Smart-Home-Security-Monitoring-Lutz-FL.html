<p>Face acknowledgment, however, is only one type of automated video analysis being deployed with surveillance cameras.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
