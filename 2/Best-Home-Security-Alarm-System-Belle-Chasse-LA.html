Again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print.

<p>When portability and movement are necessary to homeowners, wireless systems have a certain advantage, since they can be gotten rid of quickly and reinstalled quickly. With no drilling or detailed electrical wiring to be done, wireless systems usually do not need expert installation, and considering that they don't need a comprehensive and labor-intensive  elimination of wires, they can be moved relatively easily, a definite advantage for occupants and people on the go. It's a flexible kind of security technology, since sensing units can be moved and added with relative ease. They are also highly integratable, due to the fact that wireless systems can be synched up with other home automation features, such as clever locks and lights.</p>
<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, once set up, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for large homes and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your house. The group will be able to reuse the existing circuitry if you've currently installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. Nevertheless, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of three hours.</p>

But for common applications, connectivity concerns are controlled by typical supervision messages, sent daily or weekly. </p>
