<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive attacker, because the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and in fact indirectly secures information by avoiding it from being transmitted. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive assailant to tape these codes and utilize numerous splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential captured during the network recovery.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
