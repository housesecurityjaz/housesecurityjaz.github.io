<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly setting off when motion was identified. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
