<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
