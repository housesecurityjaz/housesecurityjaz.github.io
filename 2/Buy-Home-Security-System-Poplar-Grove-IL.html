<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't link. An assistance window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- however the rep asked forgiveness and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
<p>After testing, we sent out each of our top choices, as well as the Wyze Webcam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack testing.

He evaluated each camera for any impressive security flaws and concluded that all of our top picks and the budget Wyze Cam passed basic security standards and securities.</p>
