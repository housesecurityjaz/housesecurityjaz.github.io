<p>Frequently a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. Nevertheless, the 2 are drastically different.

It can be managed remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (likewise known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to couple with other wise devices and can not be controlled from another location.
