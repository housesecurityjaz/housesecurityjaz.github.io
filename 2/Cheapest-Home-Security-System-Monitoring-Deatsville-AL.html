<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
