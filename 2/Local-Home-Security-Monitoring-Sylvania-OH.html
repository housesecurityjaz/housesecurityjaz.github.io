<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion.

Guidelines such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
