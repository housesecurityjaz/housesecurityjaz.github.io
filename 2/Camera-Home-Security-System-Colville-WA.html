<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup information to make this combination work, there are only 2 alternatives. The very first choice, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is unwilling or not available to offer those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
