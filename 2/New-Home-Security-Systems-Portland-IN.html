<p>Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera offers you an impressive field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more information you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.) To see that video footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

The noise may terrify off potential intruders-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the police will not come till you personally call them. </p>
