<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera.

Commercial cameras outperform their less expensive cousins because they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adapt and record outstanding low light video.</p>

Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of private sensors or groups.  High-end systems permit multiple gain access to codes, and might even allow them to be used just when, or on particular days, or only in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center need to set up an oral code to be offered by an authorized individual in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be ensured that an additional alarm action is unnecessary. As with gain access to codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, state, for furnace repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensing unit locations however not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that allow a duress code to be gone into and silence the local alarm, but still activate the remote alarm to summon the police to a break-in.</p>
