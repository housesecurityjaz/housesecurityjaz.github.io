We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer care experience differs commonly depending on the dealer you opt for. </p>
