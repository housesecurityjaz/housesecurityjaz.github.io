<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup details to make this combination work, there are only two alternatives.

The other method is to replace and rip, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
