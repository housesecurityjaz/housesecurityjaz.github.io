<h3>Home Security Alarm Companies in Alabama</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has acquired rather the fanfare for many years. We've been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security kit that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you pick the totally free self-monitor" option.</p>

<p>Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>Prices - Basic packages are $249.50 for the equipment and $29.00 each month for monitoring. The upper-tier proposition is $299.50 for the equipment and $39.00 per month. There is a 30-day threat complimentary return deal, in addition to a 2-year guarantee. While these are plainly reasonable prices, some care is needed.

Keep in mind likewise that these have actually all included a longer-term contractual tie-in and some fairly severe early termination fees. So, make sure you understand what you're getting into before you sign the dotted line.</p>
<p>When it comes to indoor security equipment, ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all offer pet-friendly motion detectors. Their detectors use infrared technology, so its harder for a pet or cat to trip the sensing unit. Vivint's sensing units are unsusceptible to pets weighing approximately 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are immune to family pets weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can tailor the sensitivity level based upon your animal's size. </p>
