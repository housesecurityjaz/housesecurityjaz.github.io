<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
