<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
