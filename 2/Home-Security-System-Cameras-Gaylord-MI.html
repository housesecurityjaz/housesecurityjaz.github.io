The camera's seeing angle figures out how much area the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses lower the variety of cameras needed to monitor your home.

There are only 2 choices if there are no as-built files offering functionality and setup info to make this integration work. The very first option, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is reluctant or unavailable to offer those information) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the patio by a certified electrician (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
