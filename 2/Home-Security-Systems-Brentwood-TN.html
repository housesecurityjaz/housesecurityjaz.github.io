<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
