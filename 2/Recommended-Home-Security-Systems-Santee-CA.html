<h3>Digital Home Security in California</h3>
<p>A wired security camera can can be found in 2 forms, both needing wires to supply power and for the functions of video transmission. The camera's viewing angle figures out how much space the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses minimize the number of cameras required to monitor your home.
