<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their keys and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place.
