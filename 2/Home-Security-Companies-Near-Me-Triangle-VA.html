Over my 25 plus year profession in the security industry, I have investigated, sold, installed, and due to the fact that we have our own main station at American Alarm Systems, enjoyed alarm signals for more hours than I want to admit.</p>

<h3>Wireless Video Security System in Triangle VA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
