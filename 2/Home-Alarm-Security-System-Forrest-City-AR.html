<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive opponent, given that the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of data and actually indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being transferred. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the malicious assaulter to tape-record these codes and use numerous splitting tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system.

In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
