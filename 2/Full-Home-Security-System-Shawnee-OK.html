We first observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>

In short, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up much more quickly than can be made with DVR.
