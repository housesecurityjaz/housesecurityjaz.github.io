<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
