<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

And you can stop the monitoring and start service as lot of times as you desire.</p>
