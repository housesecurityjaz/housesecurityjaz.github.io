<h3>Home Alarm Equipment Proctorville OH 45669</h3>
<p>Extremely just, the person at the door presses the button. You'll get an alert to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you desire a doorbell noise too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Program, if you have one of those) - and because it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the person at the door if you so desire. Beneficial if, for instance, it's the postman and you're out. You can advise him or her where to leave the items.</p>

<p>For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

Alexa support is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera properly handles all the typical functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights head out. </p>
