<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
