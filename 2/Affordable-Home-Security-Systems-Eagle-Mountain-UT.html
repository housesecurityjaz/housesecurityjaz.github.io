<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
