<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<h3>Home Security Surveillance in Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Realistically, you will require to purchase a couple more door sensors, however that's where the Yale truly enters into its own.

<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It also implies that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would be enough to send even the most committed career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
