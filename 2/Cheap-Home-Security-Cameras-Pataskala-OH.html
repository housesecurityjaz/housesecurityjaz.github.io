<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my hubby).

I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes prior to it even saw I existed. </p>
