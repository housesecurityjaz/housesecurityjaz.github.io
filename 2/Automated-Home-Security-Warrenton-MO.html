<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see specifically when a particular person arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99).

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
