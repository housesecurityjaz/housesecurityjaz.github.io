The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the harmful enemy to record these codes and utilize numerous splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
