It can be uncomfortable and sluggish to utilize on event - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have a cable television connected however, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to sabotage for potential intruders.
