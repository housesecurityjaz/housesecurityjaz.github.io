It also has a USB slot so you can tape-record your video footage straight onto there, which saves you needing to deal with the cloud storage system explained above.</p>
<p>Cameras often relay footage online, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In many cases, surveillance systems are spent for and operated by the cities themselves. However in other cases, services and residents share surveillance camera footage with law enforcement officer. As with any security system, the more equipment you add, the more expensive it gets. When you add smart cameras to any Blue system, and that rate jumps a lot. We like that you can select from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, however every clever camera Blue offers is $200.</p>

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account.
