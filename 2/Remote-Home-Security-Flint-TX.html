<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

In fact, the majority of customers were not aware they were making such a long term dedication. This, paired with the severe charge for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may provide some pause in choosing Protect America as their home security option.</p>
