Commercial properties tend to have even greater incorrect alarm rates than residential properties due to the fact that more people tend to share responsibility for triggering and shutting off the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more intricate. The rate of incorrect alarms for commercial alarm users might be as much as three times greater than the rate of incorrect alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Persistent incorrect alarm activations are frequently due to insufficient worker training or inferior systems that have actually not been upgraded.</p>
