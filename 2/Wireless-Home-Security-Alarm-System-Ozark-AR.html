<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas.

As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
