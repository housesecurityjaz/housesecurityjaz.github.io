If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
