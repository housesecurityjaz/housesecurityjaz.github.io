<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
