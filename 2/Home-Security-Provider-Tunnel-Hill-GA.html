<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

We likewise experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months.</p>
<p>Take a while to check out online reviews and not simply those on the company's site. Take a look at the Bbb website particularly.
