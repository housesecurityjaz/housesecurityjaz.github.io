<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
