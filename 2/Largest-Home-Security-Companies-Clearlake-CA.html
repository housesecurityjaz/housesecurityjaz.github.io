<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
