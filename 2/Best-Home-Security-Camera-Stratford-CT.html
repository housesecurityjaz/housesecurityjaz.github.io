<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
