<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
