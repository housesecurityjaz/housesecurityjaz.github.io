<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide.
