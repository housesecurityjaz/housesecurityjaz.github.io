<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
