<p>Piza and associates (2019) carried out a new evaluation of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that looked at the results of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal offense avoidance. The scientists searched for CCTV evaluations released in between 2007 and 2017 to account for the period since the last evaluation (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier). Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and calling leading scientists to inquire about upcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural merging of security technologies.

<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires.
