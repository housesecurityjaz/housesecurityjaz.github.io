In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level.
