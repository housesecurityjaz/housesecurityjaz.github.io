<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. Standard elements in many home security packages consist of a master control panel, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensor device. Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms.

As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual methods of verifying if something is in fact wrong and how major the situation is.
