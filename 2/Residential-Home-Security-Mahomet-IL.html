<p>Firstly, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of day, night and use images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and automobiles.</p>
