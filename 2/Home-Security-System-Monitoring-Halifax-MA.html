ADT's 6 consumer monitoring centers (more than any other security company has) ensure your security never goes offline. If one monitoring station faces a disruption of service, your home's protection is quickly transferred to another center. Wireless security systems that are technically sophisticated and more versatile to utilize typically have better functions than the traditional systems.</p>
