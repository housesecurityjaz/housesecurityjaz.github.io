<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space.
