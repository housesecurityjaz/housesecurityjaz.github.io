Although some companies provide heavily discounted or free hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some individuals might wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
