<h3>Affordable Home Security in Georgia</h3>

It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its 3rd variation, with a simpler and more stylish design for both app and gadgets. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller, but the range is much better, promising connections to wireless sensing units as much as 800 feet away.
