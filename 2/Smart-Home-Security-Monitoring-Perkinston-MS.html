<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
