<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
