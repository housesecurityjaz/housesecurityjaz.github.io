<p>Price: Smart alarm can be more affordable because clients avoid paying someone else to install or monitor them. False alarms typically disturb next-door neighbors.

<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built files providing performance and setup details to make this combination work, there are just two choices. The very first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is not available or reluctant to provide those details) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
