<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had issues.
